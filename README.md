# 🚀 LangChain Learning — Generative AI Course by Krish Naik

This repository contains my hands-on learning journey through **LangChain**, based on **Krish Naik’s Generative AI course**.  
The goal is to explore every key component of LangChain and understand how to build real-world **LLM-powered applications**.

---

## 📘 Course Overview
LangChain is a powerful framework designed to build applications that use **large language models (LLMs)** effectively.  
Through this course, I’m exploring concepts like:
- Prompt Engineering  
- Chains and Memory  
- Agents and Tools  
- Vector Databases and Embeddings  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Chat Models and Conversational Pipelines  
- Integration with APIs (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
