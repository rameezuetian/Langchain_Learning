Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r).

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The theme is “Concepts\\nin Information Theory and Communications”.\\nThe 10th Asia-Europe workshop in “Concepts in Information Theory and Communications” is based on a\\nlongstanding cooperation between Asian and European scientists. The ﬁrst workshop was held in Eindhoven,\\nthe Netherlands in 1989. The idea of the workshop is threefold: 1) to improve the communication between\\nthe scientist in the diﬀerent parts of the world; 2) to exchange knowledge and ideas; and 3) to pay a tribute\\nto a well respected and special scientist.\\nWe are very proud that for this workshop Hirosuke Yamamoto accepted our invitation to be the guest\\nof honour. We also consider Hirosuke Yamamoto as our key lecturer. His style of presenting is extremely\\ninspiring and always very clear. The organizers want to pay special attention to these aspects. Presenters\\nare requested to pay attention to the educational aspects of their presentation and concentrate on the main\\nideas and concepts in the developed theory.\\nA special session “Hardware-Aware Information Theory” will be organized by Brian Kurkoski and Dirk\\nWbben. A special session on Powerline Communications will be organized by Adel Ghazel and Han Vinck.\\nThe mayor of Boppard, Dr. Walter Bersch, opened the AEW10 and welcomed our guests from Japan.\\nBoppard has a long tradition in the cooperation with Japan, especially the city of Ome.\\nA.

However, in several applications, it is assumed that the channels accept only sequences\\nsatisfying some constraints because input sequences violating the constraints cause malfunctions of the channels. The\\nconstraints are called input constraints of the channels.\\nOne of typical examples of input constraints is a (d, k)-constraint which requires that the lengths of runs of 0s should\\nbe at least d and at most k where ‘run’ of 0 means a sub-sequence consisting of consecutive 0s and the sub-sequence\\nis taken so that its length is as long as possible. If d = 0 and k = ∞, then the constraint is called a k-constraint and\\nd-constraint, respectively.\\nThe input constraints which can be represented by ﬁnite directed graphs with labeled edges were well studied [1].\\nMany code construction methods for input constraints were proposed. The state splitting method, proposed by Adler,\\nCoppersmith and Hassner, is one of them and universal in the following sense [2]. If we are given an input constraint\\nrepresented by a ﬁnite directed graph with an injective edge labeling and an R0 < C, then we can construct a ﬁnite\\nstate encoder with a sliding block decoder and code rate at least R0, where C is the capacity of the constraint. If the\\nedge labeling is not injective, then ﬁrst we approximate the constraint with a graph having an injective labeling from\\ninside and apply the ACH coding to the approximation of the constraint [3].\\nSince codes for channels with input constraint are actually used in practical devices, the compactness of the resulting\\ncode and performance indices related to speciﬁc applications should be taken into account in designing the codes.\\nHence, coding techniques speciﬁc to some input constraints were also proposed. These techniques may produce codes\\nwhich are more compact than codes produced by the general techniques. K. Immink proposed many techniques for\\n(d, k)-constraints and a spectral null constraint. These techniques can be found in [4].\\nHere we consider a code construction techniques for the d-constraint given in [4, Section 7.7]. The techniques usually\\ngives small codes. The technique was applied to phase change memory (PCM) by K. Cai in order to construct codes\\nfor a k constraint with very high eﬃciency [5]. The k-constraint for PCM is imposed so that some performance index\\nof the resulting code is optimized. The performance index depends on constrained sequences actually produced by\\nthe resulting code. If we use the Immink coding technique in designing the code, we can easily adjust the code by\\nappropriately choosing code words so that the performance index is optimized.\\nWe interpret the Immink coding technique in terms of the state splitting method and characterize the coding\\ntechnique using follower sets. Then we generalize the coding technique. We also give a constraint to which the coding\\ntechnique can be applied.\\nReferences\\n[1] C.

INTRODUCTION\\nA ﬂash memory is a high-density non-violate memory\\nwhich has been used in data storage devices such as USB\\nmemories or SSDs. Each ﬂash memory consists of cells\\n(ﬂoating gates) which accumulate electric charges for storing\\nmessages. More precisely, a ﬂash memory stores messages\\nby adding electric charges to the cells, and reads messages\\nby quantizing electric charges stored in the cells. It is easy\\nto increase the charge levels of cells since it can be done by\\ninjecting charges per cell. However, it is costly to decrease the\\ncharge levels since it must be done per block (a huge set of\\ncells). Hence, many effective coding schemes which considers\\nthe constraint on overwriting have been studied (e.g., [1], [2]).\\nIt is also important to handle possible errors of ﬂash\\nmemories for accurate message readout. For example, an inter-\\ncell interference (ICI), a shift of charge levels due to the\\ninterference of charges in neighbouring cells, is a typical noise\\nfor ﬂash memories. Since the likelihood of ICI depends on a\\ndata sequence stored in cells, messages should be encoded so\\nthat resulting data sequences do not contain subsequences that\\ncan cause ICI (constraint on sequences) (e.g., [3], [4]).\\nTherefore, for producing reliable ﬂash memories, it is\\ndesired to consider both constraints into consideration. It\\nimplies the necessity of analysis on two-dimensional con-\\nstrained systems, but the analysis is cumbersome, and many\\nproblems have been open up to this moment. We will therefore\\nfocus on Periodic-Finite-Type shifts (PFTs), a class of one-\\ndimensional soﬁc shifts, and discuss how they can be used as a\\nmathematical model of ﬂash memories considering constraints.\\nII. DISCUSSION\\nLet Σ be an alphabet, and denote by Σ∗and ΣZ the sets\\nof ﬁnite sequences (words) and bi-inﬁnite sequences over Σ,\\nrespectively. Deﬁne the shift map σ : ΣZ →ΣZ so that for\\na bi-inﬁnite sequence x = . . . x−1x0x1 . . . over Σ, the i-th\\nsymbol of σ(x) is equal to xi+1. For simplicity, let σr(x) be\\nthe bi-inﬁnite sequence generated by applying σ r times to x.\\nA periodic ﬁnite shift S{F,P } [5], [6] is a set of bi-inﬁnite\\nsequences characterized by period P and an ordered list F =\\n(F0, F1, . . . , FP −1) of ﬁnite forbidden sets Fj ⊂Σ∗, which\\nforbids the appearance of words in a periodic manner. More\\nprecisely, a bi-inﬁnite sequence x = . . . x−1x0x1 . . . is in\\nS{F,P } if and only if there exists an integer r, 0 ≤r ≤P −1,\\nsuch that σr(x) does not contain any word in Fj as a subword\\nstarting at the positions i satisfying i ≡j (mod P). PFTs\\nare also soﬁc shifts; that is, each PFT has its presentation\\n(a labelled directed graph whose bi-inﬁnite labelled paths\\nrepresent bi-inﬁnite sequences in the PFT).\\nConsider a block consisting of n q-level cells, and suppose\\nthat data sequences are overwritten in the block. Let Σ =\\n{0, 1, . . . , q −1} and ℓ(t) = (ℓ(t)\\n1 , ℓ(t)\\n2 , . . . , ℓ(t)\\nn ) ∈Σn be the\\nstored data sequence at the t-th write; that is, the i-th element\\nof ℓ(t) represents the charge level of the i-th cell at the t-th\\nwrite.

This concept provides building blocks for\\ncodes achieving the fundamental limits.\\nOur study on the construction of codes achieving the\\nShannon limits has been continued for over ten years. Tools\\nfor the code construction has been developed one by one and\\npublished in the subsequent papers. This talk reviews and\\nsummarizes our results for the construction of a channel code\\nachieving the fundamental limits. The construction of a lossy\\ncode is presented in [4][5].\\nThe idea of the construction is originated from the applica-\\ntion of the Slepian-Wolf code to channel coding. This idea was\\nﬁrst presented in this workshop [3, Section III], and published\\nin [14, Theorem 4]. Later, we noticed that the similar idea had\\nalready been given by Shannon [15, Fig. 8]. He assumed that\\nan observer has access to both input and output of a channel\\nand send the difference of them to the decoder. In contrast,\\nour idea suggests that such an observer is unnecessary by\\nsharing the common information between the encoder and the\\ndecoder. However, there was no practical construction of both\\nan encoder and a decoder.\\nThe ﬁrst progress is using a two functions (sparse matrices)\\nto construct a code. The effectiveness of this idea was shown\\nin [1][2]. Later, the essence of this idea, which is called hash\\nproperty, was introduced in [6][7], where it is shown that\\nthe idea can be applied to the constructions of multi-terminal\\ncodes [8][9][11]. However, encoding and decoding were still\\nintractable.\\nThe second progress is using a stochastic encoder called\\na constrained-random-number generator introduced in [4][5],\\nwhere the theoretical study comes from [10]. Two approxi-\\nmation algorithms using the sum-product algorithm and the\\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo method were developed. This\\ntime, we obtained tractable algorithms for encoding but the\\nproof of achievablity to the fundamental limit depends on\\nthe use of the maximum-likelihood decoder, which is still\\nintractable.\\nThe third progress is separating encoding and decoding\\nfunctions. In our above results, we had to ﬁnd a pair of good\\nfunctions (sparse matrices) to achieve the fundamental limit.\\nIt is shown in [12] that for a given arbitrary function we can\\nconstruct a code achieving the fundamental limit.\\nThe last progress is using a constrained-random-number\\ngenerator for the stochastic decoding. The effectiveness of\\nthis idea will be presented in [13]. The result implies that\\nboth an encoder and a decoder can be constructed by using\\nconstrained-random-number generators, where we can use\\ntractable encoding/decoding algorithms by using the sum-\\nproduct algorithm and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] S.

The proposed\\ncode C is a linear [n, n −2] code over GF(p) where p ≡1( mod 2d) is a prime or a power of a prime and the code\\nlength parameter n is a certain integer such that n ≤(p −1)/(2d). The proposed code corrects double errors in the\\nerror set Ep,d = {±1, ±αv, . . . , ±α(d−1)v} where α is a primitive element of GF(p) and v = (p −1)/(2d).\\nThe proposed code is suitable for the multidimensional signal constellations. For examples, it can be applied to\\ncorrect at most double nearest neighbor errors on the square signal constellation in case of d = 2 and on the hexagonal\\nsignal constellation in case of d = 3. And specially, in case of d = 1, the proposed code is equivalent to the double error\\ncorrecting code, called negacyclic code proposed by Berlekamp [1] where a decoding algorithm for the negacyclic codes\\nis proposed as well. After four decades, his decoding algorithm has been simpliﬁed by Roth [2], and recently Huber [3]\\nhas made Roth’s algorithm much more accessible to readers in other ﬁelds.\\nThe aim of this presentation is twofold. One is to construct double N-N error-correcting codes for the error set Ep,d\\nmentioned above. The other is to give the corresponding decoding algorithm which corrects more general N-N errors\\nthan {+1, −1} errors. And an example of the decoding process will be shown for d = 3, that is, N-N error correcting\\ncodes on a hexagonal signal constellation.\\nReferences\\n[1] E. Berlekamp, Algebraic Coding Theory.

First, known methods are re-\\nviewed for detecting burst errors and human operation\\nerrors, respectively. Furthermore, we look into their\\nconnections and propose research challenges.\\nI. Introduction\\nWhen information is transmitted over noisy communi-\\ncation systems, it may get scrambled by noise or data may\\nget corrupted. To cope with this, error-detecting codes are\\noften used to help us detect if an error has occurred during\\ntransmission of the message. Note that the system channel\\nmay be a telephone line, a high frequency radio link, or\\na satellite communication link. The noise may be caused\\nby human errors, lightnings, thermal ﬂuctuations, imper-\\nfection in equipment, etc. Due to diﬀerent transmission\\nmedium and noise, errors may exhibit distinct statistical\\ncharacteristics in various application scenarios.\\nTo detect the errors, additional digits (i.e., check digits)\\nare added to the data at the time of transmission. The data\\nalong with the check digits form a codeword. The whole\\nphilosophy of error detection is based on the assumption\\nthat the errors which a code is designed to detect are very\\nfrequent compared with the errors not guarded against by\\nit. Therefore, to design a good error-detecting code, the\\nvery ﬁrst and important task is to have a good understand-\\ning of the statistical behavior of the errors. In this paper,\\nwe will discuss two kinds of errors: 1) burst errors (that\\nare common in many communication channels) and 2)\\nhuman operation errors. Known error-detecting methods\\ndeveloped for both are reviewed, respectively.\\nII. Known error-detecting methods\\nA. Burst errors\\nBurst errors are common transmission errors in many\\ncommunication channels, including magnetic and optical\\nstorage devices. To cope with such errors, a cyclic re-\\ndundancy check (CRC) code [1] (based on polynomial\\ndivision) is very suitable. Due to its easy implementation\\nin binary hardware, numerous varieties of CRCs have been\\nincorporated into technical standards.\\nB. Human operation errors\\nHuman operation errors could be divided into the fol-\\nlowing two classes: 1) Cognitive Errors and 2) Typographic\\nErrors. For more detailed classiﬁcation, one can refer to\\nThis work is supported in part by DFG Grant CH 601/2-1.\\nthe empirical investigations by Beckley [2] and Verhoeﬀ\\n[3].\\nThere is a long list of research articles aiming to de-\\nsign good error-detecting codes against human operation\\nerrors, by using one of the following methods: a) division;\\nb) parity check; c) weighted parity check; d) Luhn formula;\\ne) hybrid system; f) Verhoeﬀ’s method; and g) polynomial.\\nThe underlying ideas include the basic decimal arithmetic\\n(e.g., (a) division), make use of operation over groups [6]\\n(e.g., (b) parity check and (c) weighted parity check meth-\\nods), non-commutative operation over Dihedral groups\\n(e.g.: (f) Verhoeﬀ’s method [3], [4]), and multiplication\\nover ﬁnite ﬁelds (e.g., (g) polynomial method [5]) and\\nvector-matrix multiplications in matrix algebra [7], [8].\\nIII. Open research problems\\nGenerally speaking, a error detecting code can be de-\\nscribed by (n, t, A, G), where n, t are the lengths of the in-\\nformation digits and check digits, respectively; A is the al-\\nphabet (which size can be numerical, alphabetic, alphanu-\\nmeric etc), and G is the operation group/quasigroup. Note\\nthat the well-developed error-control codes work over a\\nﬁnite ﬁeld of a prime power order (and are analyzed for\\nrandom errors). However, the error detection codes desired\\nfor speciﬁed applications may aim for detecting some kinds\\nof atypical errors, and could have an alphabet size beyond\\nthis category. For instance, the best decimal code (with\\n|A| = |G| = 10) is still Verhoeﬀ’s code [3] over the dihedral\\ngroup D5, which was generalized by Gumm in [4] to a code\\nwith alphabet of size 2s, s odd.\\nReferences\\n[1] W.

INTRODUCTION\\nIn the context of channel coding theorems for block codes,\\nrelations among the probability of decoding error, the codeword\\nlength, and the coding rate are discussed. One of famous\\nand classical results in that context is the error exponent,\\nwhich characterizes an exponential error bound converging to\\neither zero or one as the codeword length increases. Consider\\ndiscrete memoryless channels (DMCs). Let random variables\\nX and Y be the input and output of a DMC, respectively. We\\ndenote by PX and WY |X the input and the transition probability\\ndistributions of a DMC, respectively. For a coding rate R\\nbelow capacity and a codeword length N, Gallager [4] gave\\nan exponential upper bound on the probability of maximum\\nlikelihood (ML) error for good codes by deriving the random\\ncoding exponent1\\nEr(R, PX, WY |X) ≔max\\n0≤ρ≤1\\n!\\nE0(ρ, PX, WY |X) −ρR\\n\"\\n,\\n(1)\\nwhere Gallager’s reliability function E0 is deﬁned by\\nE0(ρ, PX, WY |X) ≔−log\\n#\\ny∈Y\\n$ #\\nx∈X\\nPX(x)WY |X(y | x)\\n1\\n1+ρ\\n%1+ρ\\n.\\nIf PX is uniform, we simply write the E0 function as\\nE0(ρ, WY |X). Later, Shannon et al. [12] and Arimoto [2] also\\nderived the sphere packing and the strong converse exponents,\\nrespectively, as functions of the E0 function to give exponential\\nlower bounds on the probability of ML error for arbitrary codes.\\nIn this paper, we investigate extremal q-ary input DMCs\\nachieving the maximum and minimum values of E0(ρ, WY |X)\\nunder a ﬁxed another channel reliability function. Such ex-\\ntremalities were studied by Guill´en i F`abregas et al. [5] and\\nAlsan [1] in binary-input cases, and by the authors in ternary-\\ninput cases. In the paper, we introduce a method for deriving\\nextremalities of arbitrary input DMCs for E0(ρ, WY |X) from\\nsharp bounds on R´enyi’s information measures [10], [11].\\nThis work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI, Grant-in-Aid for\\nScientiﬁc Research (C) 26420352 and 17K06422, and Grant-in-Aid for JSPS\\nResearch Fellow 17J11247.\\n1The error exponent Er is usually deﬁned as maxPX Er(R, PX, WY |X),\\nwhere the maximization is taken over all input distributions.\\nII. CONNECTION WITH R´ENYI’S INFORMATION MEASURES\\nIf X follows a uniform distribution, then\\nE0(ρ, WY |X) = Hα(X) −Hα(X | Y)\\n(2)\\nwith α = 1/(1+ρ), where Hα(X) denotes the R´enyi entropy [6]\\nand Hα(X | Y) denotes Arimoto’s conditional R´enyi entropy [2].\\nIn [10], [11], many sharp upper and lower bounds on R´enyi’s\\ninformation measures were derived together with extremal\\nprobability distributions achieving the bounds. Combining\\nthese, we can establish extremalities of arbitrary input DMCs\\nfor E0(ρ, WY |X). As a result, for example, extremal DMCs\\nachieving the maximum and minimum values of the random\\ncoding exponents with a ﬁxed different R´enyi’s information\\nmeasure can be clariﬁed. As summarized in [9, Section II],\\nsome notions of symmetry for DMCs and the method of channel\\nsymmetrization are useful to establish the extremalities for\\nchannel reliability functions under a uniform input distribution.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] M.

Yao (1979) in the study of parallel computation. It found, since,\\nsurprising applications in many areas of computer science as VLSI layout, switching circuits, and auction theory.\\nA recent hot topic much related to communication complexity is information complexity. The setting can be described\\nas follows.\\nIs it signiﬁcantly easier to compute several instances of a problem simultaneously than sequentially? An aﬃrma-\\ntive answer to this question for communication complexity (the so-called direct-sum conjecture due to Wigderson)\\nwould have deep impact in circuit complexity. Recently, for probabilistic protocols the amortized (= simultaneous)\\ncommunication complexity could be characterized as an information expression.\\nIn the probabilistic setting, a randomized protocol can be regarded as a random variable Π, hence, a probability\\ndistribution on all possible communication protocols. Further, there are deﬁned random variables X and Y on the\\ninputs of the two communicators. The (internal) information complexity I(Π, Y |X) + I(Π, X|Y ) now is the sum of the\\nmutual informations of the protocol with each of the communicators inputs.\\nIt turns out that this information complexity characterizes the amortized communication complexity for probabilistic\\nprotocols. Such a single-letter characterization for some special functions was obtained for deterministic protocols by\\nthe Bielefeld group in the early 1990’s. These results coincide with a general formula in this case conjectured in the\\nsurvey by Braverman et al. in the IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter.\\n8\\nFeature Selection for Computer-Aided Detection of\\nCancer types\\nPeter H.N. de With, Fons van der Sommen, Patrick Langenhuizen and Joost van der Putten\\nEindhoven University of Technology, PO Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven, NL\\nBarrett’s Esophagus (BE) is a condition in which the body replaces the normal lining of the esophagus with an\\nacid-resistant cell type, to prevent tissue damage caused by gastric reﬂux. This is correlated with an unhealthy lifestyle\\nand it is a known precursor of esophageal cancer, yielding an over 30-fold increased chance of this deadly disease.\\nFor further developed cancer stages in brain tumors, cancer detection occurs frequently at later stage, but in such a\\ncase, cancer detection with imaging can support tumor control of vestibular schwannomas (VS) after gamma knife\\nradiosurgery. Here, the detection during treatment can be exploited to correlate the cancer with pre-treatment growth\\nrate to measure eﬀectivity of the radiosurgery. A similar case occurs with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA),\\nwhich is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death with a 5-year survival rate in the western world. While surgery\\nis currently the only potentially curative therapy, only 15-20% of the patients are considered for resection, since the rest\\nof the patients have an advanced stage of cancer for which curative surgery treatment is too late. Here, preoperatively\\npredicting the prognosis of PDA is important in the determination of the most appropriate treatment strategy.\\nIn all of the above cases, cancer detection based on advanced image analysis is crucial to determine the character-\\nization and behavior of the cancer to come to prediction of the treatment and/or resection decisions. The usefulness\\nof computer-aided support for analysis of the disease has passed the point of discussion, but the reliable detection of\\nspeciﬁc forms of cancer still depends on applied types of imaging and the search for the best image features describing\\nthe cancerous tissue properties is still ongoing. In this paper we discuss the exploration of various image features to\\nsupport a reliable and robust detection.\\nIn the BE study, several popular computer vision methods for detection are evaluated. Furthermore, we introduce\\nnew, clinically-inspired features and compare the detection performance of the investigated methods to that of clinical\\nendoscopic and VLE experts. Typical features for evaluation are spectral features like multi-directional Gabor wavelets\\nand statistical features like the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Histogram\\nof Oriented Gradients (HOG) features as well as features from the Fully Connected (FC) layers of ALexNet as used\\nin Deep Learning. With a maximal Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.95 for the proposed features versus an AUC of\\n0.81 for the VLE experts, this study shows that computer-aided detection methods oﬀer a quite promising technique\\nfor the interpretation of VLE data [1].\\nFor VS detection in the brain, in an initial study Tumor Volume Doubling Time (VDT) prior to treatment was\\ncalculated using pretreatment MRI scan, at least 6 months before treatment, and the treatment MRI scan. Objective\\ncriteria of failure were applied, based on tumor volumes: after initial pseudo-progression period of 2 years, showing\\ntwice a volumetric tumor progression of at least 10%, consecutively. VDTs were correlated with observed tumor control\\nrates and volumetric responses.\\nFor PDA detection, we present the ﬁrst experiments for automated determination of resectability using CT scans.\\nThe tumor features are extracted from a group of patients with both hypo- and iso-attenuating tumors of which 33 were\\nresectable and 37 were not. The tumor contours are supplied by a medical expert. We present an approach that uses\\nintensity, shape, and texture features to determine tumor resectability. A broad set of statistical features is compared\\nand various feature selection algorithms are exploited to ﬁnd the best descriptors. It was found that Logistic Regression\\nof the feature vector containing a broad set of statistical features was the best to be combined with a decision tree\\nalgorithm, in order to obtain the highest classiﬁcation result. Compared to expert predictions made on a similar data\\nset, our method reaches better classiﬁcation results, but the data set is still limited. We obtain up to 28% gain on\\ncorrectly predicting non-resectability, which is essential for patient treatment.\\nReferences\\n[1] S.

INTRODUCTION\\nThe advent of recent powerful neural networks (NN) trig-\\ngered explosive spread of research activities and applica-\\ntions on deep neural networks (DNN). The DNN also have\\nfound many practical applications such as image recognition,\\nspeech recognition and robotics because of their excellent\\nperformance compared with traditional methods. For example,\\nin image recognition competitions, it was recently shown\\nthat deep neural networks achieves recognition performance\\ncomparable to that of human. It is natural to exploit the\\npotential of DNN for data compression applications. In this\\npaper, we study a lossy encoding scheme based on binarized\\nautoencoder. The proposed method is well matched to neural\\nnetwork-based pattern classiﬁers.\\nII. AUTOENCODERS\\nAutoencoders are a well known class of neural networks.\\nAn autoencoder is trained so that squared Euclidean distances\\nbetween inputs and outputs becomes small. Combined with a\\nsuitable regulation terms in the loss function, we can obtain\\na special representation of inputs at the hidden layer such as\\nsparse representation of inputs.\\nThe architecture of autoencoder with 3-layers are the fol-\\nlowing. Let x ∈Rn be the input to the network. The values\\nof the hidden layer are given by h = f(Wx + b) where\\nW ∈Rm×n is a weight matrix and b ∈Rm is a bias vector.\\nThe function f : R →R is a nonlinear function called an\\nactivation function. The values of the output layers are given\\nby ˆx = ˆf( ˆWx + ˆb) where ˆW ∈Rm×n and ˆb ∈Rm. The\\nfunction ˆf : R →R is also an activation function. The set of\\nparameters Θ = {W, ˆW, b, ˆb} are adjusted in a training phase\\nso as to minimize the loss function ||x −ˆx||2\\n2 or another loss\\nfunction.\\nIII. BINALIZED AUTOENCODER\\nThe proposed lossy encoder consists of an autoencoder with\\na binary quantization hidden layer, which is called a binalized\\nautoencoder. The values of hidden layer are quantized as h =\\nsign(Wx + b). The function sign(a) gives value 1 if a ≥0;\\notherwise it takes the value 0. We also introduce constraint\\nW = ˆW T . The vector h can be considered as a compressed\\ncoded sequence corresponding to the input x\\nIV. COMPUTER EXPERIMENTS\\nWe performed computer experiments for evaluating the\\ncompression performance of the proposed scheme. As a\\ndataset, we used the MNIST handwritten number dataset in\\nthe experiments. A pixel data in the MNIST dataset has\\n784 pixels (28 × 28) and each white-black pixel has 8-bit\\ndepth. In this experiments, we used the sigmoid function\\nσ(a) = 1/(1 + exp(−a)) at the output layer, i.e., ˆf = σ. The\\nloss function used in the training process is the cross entropy\\nfunction deﬁned by\\n−1\\nnNt\\n!\\ni∈Dt\\nn\\n!\\nj=0\\n{x(i)\\nj log ˆx(i)\\nj\\n+ (1 −x(i)\\nj ) log(1 −ˆx(i)\\nj )},\\nwhere Dt is the t-th mini-batch and Nt denotes the number\\nof data items in the mini-batch Dt. In the experiments, we\\ncompressed randomly chosen pixel data from the MSNIT\\ndataset and measured the compression rate and successful\\nrecognition rate. As a pattern classiﬁer, a convolutional neural\\nnetwork with successful recognition rate 99.4% was used.\\nFigure 1 summarizes results of the computer experiments.\\nThe horizontal axis of Fig.1 represents the compression rate\\nand the vertical axis indicates the successful recognition rate.\\nThe parameters used in the experiments are the following:\\nNt = 100, learning coefﬁcient 0.25, the number of learning\\nepochs 50000.

For lossy data compression the celebrated\\nRate-Distortion theory provides the compression rate in order to\\nquantize a signal without exceeding a given distortion measure.\\nRecently, with the Information Bottleneck method an alternative\\napproach has been emerged in the ﬁeld of machine learning\\nand has been successfully applied for data processing. The\\nfundamental idea is to include the original source into the\\nproblem setup when quantizing an observation variable and\\nto use strictly information theoretic measures to design the\\nquantizer. This paper introduces this framework and discusses\\nalgorithmic implementations for the quantizer design.\\nI. EXTENDED ABSTRACT\\nA fundamental task in data processing is the quantized\\nrepresentation of noisy observations of an original source\\nsignal. Fig. 1 shows the considered system model consisting\\nof a data source, a transmission channel and a quantizer.\\ndata source\\nquantizer\\nchannel\\ny ∈Y\\nz ∈Z\\nx ∈X\\np(y|x)\\np(z|y)\\np(x)\\nFig. 1. General system model for the quantization of noisy observations\\nWithout loss of generality, we assume the random variable\\nx with realizations x ∈X following the probability mass\\nfunction (pmf) p(x) as a discrete memoryless source (DMS).\\nThe observation variable y with realizations y ∈Y is the\\noutput of a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) characterized\\nby its transition probability distribution p(y|x). Furthermore,\\nthe random variable z with realizations z ∈Z is the output\\nof the quantizer block being characterized by the conditional\\ndistribution p(z|y). Thus, the quantizer output z is a compact\\nrepresentation of y with cardinality |Z| ≤|Y|. The design\\nof the quantizer p(z|y) realizes a trade-off between the\\ncompression rate, I(y; z), and the quality of the compressed\\nrepresentation.\\nThe Rate-Distortion (RD) theory provides the minimal\\nnumber of bits per symbol in order to represent the received\\nsignal without exceeding an upper-bound on a given distortion\\nmeasure, e.g., the mean square error (MSE) between the\\nquantizer input signal and its representative at the output\\n[1]. Speciﬁcally, the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm determines the\\nlowest achievable compression rate for a certain maximum\\ntolerable distortion. The main drawbacks of this formulation\\nare the lack of a systematic way to choose a proper distortion\\nmeasure for any case of pertinence and the fact, that the\\nstochastic relation between the noisy observation and the\\noriginal data source is not considered.\\nIn [2], Tishby et al. have introduced the Information Bot-\\ntleneck (IB) method for data compression. The central idea\\nis to compress the observation y such that the quantizer\\noutput z preserves most of the information about the relevant\\nvariable, i.e., the original source x. Furthermore, IB avoids the\\na priori speciﬁcation of a distortion measure by considering\\nthe mutual information I(x; z) between the quantizer output\\nand the original data source. In this fashion, the output of the\\nquantizer becomes a compact representation of its input which\\nis highly informative about the actual source of interest.\\nGiven the joint probability distribution of the source and\\nthe channel output p(x, y) = p(x) p(y|x) and assuming\\nx ↔y ↔z to be a Markov chain, the quantizer should be\\ndesigned such that the output z is a compact representation\\nof the input y which is highly informative about x. Mathe-\\nmatically, the existent trade-off between the compression rate,\\nI(y; z), and the relevant information, I(x; z), is established\\nby the introduction of a non-negative Lagrange multiplier, β,\\nin the design formulation. Hence, for an allowed number of\\nquantizer output levels, n, the corresponding design problem\\nfollows as [2]\\np⋆(z|y)=argmin\\np(z|y)\\n1\\nβ+1\\n!\\nI(y; z)−βI(x; z)\\n\"\\nfor |Z|≤n . (1)\\nThe optimal quantizer mapping for (1) can be derived by\\nmeans of variational calculus. Explicitly, for a speciﬁc value\\nof β the mapping p(z|y) is a stationary point of the objective\\nfunction in (1), if and only if\\np(z|y) =\\np(z)\\nψ(y, β)e−βDKL(p(x|y)∥p(x|z))\\n(2)\\nis met for all pairs (y, z) ∈Y × Z. The function ψ(y, β)\\nnormalizes the mapping p(z|y) to ensure a valid distribution\\nfor each y ∈Y and DKL(· ∥· ) is the Kullback-Leibler (KL)\\ndivergence. The derived optimal mapping in (2) has an implicit\\nform, as the cluster representative (in a conventional sense)\\np(x|z) and the cluster probability p(z) appearing on the right\\nside of (2), depend on the quantizer mapping p(z|y) by\\np(z) =\\n#\\ny∈Y\\np(y) p(z|y)\\n(3)\\n13\\n13\\nand\\np(x|z) =\\n1\\np(z)\\n!\\ny∈Y\\np(x, y) p(z|y) .\\n(4)\\nThe iterative calculation of (2)-(4) leads to the Iterative In-\\nformation Bottleneck (It-IB) algorithm [2]. Several alternative\\napproaches to determine mapping functions in order to meet\\nthe trade-off between compression rate and relevant informa-\\ntion have been discussed in the literature such as\\n• Agglomerative Information Bottleneck (Agg-IB) [3]\\n• Sequential Information Bottleneck (Seq-IB) [4]\\n• Deterministic Information Bottleneck (Det-IB) [5]\\n• KL-means Information Bottleneck (KL-means-IB) [6]\\n• Channel-Optimized Information Bottleneck (Ch-Opt-IB)\\n[7].\\nFor the special case of binary input alphabet computationally\\nefﬁcient adaptations exist as discussed in [8].\\nSubsequently, we compare the performance of the algo-\\nrithms for 4-ASK (x ∈{±1, ±3}) input signals transmitted\\nover AWGN channels with noise variance σ2\\nn = 1. Further-\\nmore, to acquire the channel transition distribution p(y|x),\\nthe continuous channel output is clipped at an amplitude of\\n3 σn above the maximum input signal (i.e., 6 for 4-ASK)\\nand uniformly discretized to |Y| = 128 values. In particular,\\nwe investigate the accuracy by the mutual information loss\\n∆I = I(x; y) −I(x; z) and the complexity-precision trade-off\\nby the corresponding compression rate I(y; z) for different\\nvalues of β over varying allowed number of clusters n.\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n10−2\\n10−1\\n100\\nNumber of Clusters\\nMutual Information Loss (in bits)\\na) β = 100\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n10−2\\n10−1\\n100\\nNumber of Clusters\\nb) β = 400\\nIt-IB\\nSeq-IB\\nAgg-IB\\nDet-IB\\nKL-means-IB\\nCh-Opt-IB\\nFig. 2.

One may note, as the resultant mapping of all al-\\ngorithms (except for the Agg-IB) depends on the initialization,\\nto achieve the corresponding curves, they have been run 105\\ntimes, with the best taken. Except for the KL-means-IB and\\nthe Ch-Opt-IB (both only consider β →∞) one can observe,\\nthat the accuracy of all algorithms is improved by increasing β\\nfrom 100 to 400. For a fair comparison with the KL-means-IB\\nand the Ch-Opt-IB we concentrate subsequently on Fig. 2 b)\\nwith a relatively high value of β.\\nFirst of all, the non-smooth behavior of the Det-IB is due\\nto the fact that its provided mapping does not necessarily use\\nthe entire allowed number of clusters, i.e., |Z| < n. As an\\nexample, for n = 12 the used number of bins is smaller than\\nthe case of n = 10, leading to a coarser result. Furthermore,\\nit can be seen that the It-IB and the KL-means-IB exhibit\\nnearly the same performance over the entire range of allowed\\nnumber of bins n. In addition, one notes that the Ch-Opt-IB\\nalso sweeps the corresponding curve of the It-IB for n ≤10.\\nThe reason behind these observations is discussed in [9] where\\nthe asymptotic algorithmic equivalence of these algorithms is\\nproven.\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n100\\n100.2\\n100.4\\n100.6\\nNumber of Clusters\\nCompression Rate (in bits)\\na) β = 100\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n100\\n100.2\\n100.4\\n100.6\\nNumber of Clusters\\nb) β = 400\\nIt-IB\\nSeq-IB\\nAgg-IB\\nDet-IB\\nKL-means-IB\\nCh-Opt-IB\\nFig. 3.

Kurkoski\\nJapan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Nomi, Japan\\nEmail: kurkoski@jaist.ac.jp\\nThe max-LUT method is an approach for implementing factor graph-based decoders and detectors using lookup\\ntables (LUTs). In factor graphs, nodes compute output messages as a function of input messages. In the max-LUT\\nmethod, these functions are implemented by LUTs, rather than by conventional mathematical operations. The LUT is\\ndesigned to maximize mutual information between the output message and the information symbol it represents; this\\nis a natural choice since maximizing mutual information leads to the highest achievable communications rates. The\\nentire system is assumed to be discrete, since LUTs themselves produce discrete outputs from discrete inputs.\\nThe max-LUT method is especially appealing for hardware implementations. For example, factor-graph LDPC\\ndecoders are commonly implemented in VLSI with ﬁxed-precision arithmetic. Engineers often take a time-consuming\\ntrial-and-error approach to designing such decoders. The max-LUT method provides a systematic approach to design\\nsuch decoders. In practice, such decoders have very good performance, when compared to other decoders of similar\\nprecision. Another example is implementation of computer simulations - the max-LUT method signiﬁcantly reduces\\nthe simulation time of LDPC decoding algorithms.\\nConsider a general degree-three factor-graph node, Fig. 1. The factor graph node expresses a relationship f between\\nthree random variables X1, X2 and X3, which are code symbols; this encoder-side perspective is shown in Fig. 1-(a).\\nThe factor graph node also has a decoder-side perspective, shown in Fig. 1-(b). Three random variables L, Z and V are\\nmessages about the code symbols X1, X2 and X3, respectively, where L and Z are inputs and V is the output. In the\\ncase of a binary LDPC code check node, the function f expresses f(X1, X2) = X1 + X2 with modulo-two arithmetic.\\nIn the case of an binary LDPC variable node, the function f expresses:\\nf(X1, X2) =\\n!\\nX1\\nif X1 = X2\\nundeﬁned\\nif X1 ̸= X2\\n.\\n(1)\\nThe conditional distributions pL|X1(ℓ|x1) and pZ|X2(z|x2) are known. This may be obtained from the channel noise\\nmodel, for example.\\nX1\\nX2\\nX3\\nf\\nL\\nZ\\nV\\nLUT\\n(a) Encoder Side\\n(b) Decoder Side\\nFig. 1: (a) Encoder-side representation of a factor graph. (b) Decoder-side representation of factor graph.\\nWith these inputs, the max-LUT method proceeds as follows, and is shown in Fig. 2. It is straightforward to\\nconstruct the conditional distribution pL,Z|X3(ℓ, z|x3) from the given conditional distributions and f. It is desired to\\nﬁnd a function LUT which computes a new variable v from the input variables ℓ, z:\\nv = LUT(ℓ, z).\\n(2)\\nTo do this, ﬁnd the LUT* which maximizes mutual information I(V ; X3) :\\nLUT* = arg max\\nLUT\\nI(V ; X3) or\\n(3)\\n= arg max\\nLUT\\nI(LUT(L, Z); X3).\\n(4)\\nThis maximization problem is equivalent to designing a quantizer for a discrete memoryless channel, and is connected\\nwith the classiﬁcation problem in machine learning.

When the Xi are binary, there is an optimal dynamic programming\\napproach. When Xi are non-binary, eﬃcient but suboptimal approaches such as the information bottleneck method,\\nor the KL-means algorithm (which is the K-means algorithm with Kullback-Leiber divergence metric).\\nThe above method has been applied to decoding of LDPC codes.

On an SDR\\nplatform, most parts of the signal processing chain are implemented in software that is run on a digital signal\\nprocessor (DSP), a general purpose processor (GPP) or heterogeneous hardware. The aim of the presented work\\nwas to validate the assumption that the integer based decoding process in discrete decoders which results from\\npurely information theoretical considerations also oﬀers practical gains in a decoder implementation suitable for\\nSDR applications. For this purpose, a discrete decoder was implemented on a Texas Instruments TMS3206474\\nDSP using a TMDSEVM6474L evaluation board and compared with several state-of-the-art message passing\\ndecoders on the same hardware.\\nChallenges: Naturally, memory addressing and memory access latency have strong inﬂuence on the de-\\ncoding throughput of discrete decoders.\\nThe DSP natively supports standard 8, 16 and 32 bit data types.\\nHowever, discrete LDPC decoders show very good performance also with shorter messages. A bit width of 4\\nbit is suﬃcient to perform very close to double precision belief propagation decoders for binary input additive\\nwhite Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. Embedding 4 bit data in standard data types requires additional\\noperations for bitﬁeld extraction. It was a challenge to ﬁnd a good trade-oﬀbetween memory usage of the\\ndecoder and fast memory access. We developed a technique which accepts larger lookup tables for a simpler\\naddressing operation of the lookup table entries in the decoder. Moreover, we studied several methods to obtain\\na decoder implementation with a small memory footprint. The lookup tables holding the decoding mappings for\\nall decoder iterations are accessed extremely often during the iterative decoding process. The TMS320C6474\\nDSP is not especially optimized for fast memory access. However, we found it to be beneﬁcial for the discrete\\nLDPC decoding process that the DSP has the huge number of 32 registers. It was a challenge to develop a\\ndiscrete decoder implementation which makes use of this strength of the selected hardware platform.\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n0\\n200\\n400\\n600\\ndiscrete decoder\\n4 bit messages\\nmin-sum with\\njacobian log.\\nmin-sum\\nEb/N0 [dB]\\nnet decoding throughput [kbit/s]\\nFigure 1: Decoding throughput of several it-\\nerative decoders on the TMS320C6474 DSP.\\nResults: The novel discrete LDPC decoder was tested for a\\nquantized output AWGN channel with binary phase shift keying\\nmodulation and exemplary (3, 6)-regular LDPC codes for vary-\\ning Eb/N0.

Email: Hirosuke@ieee.org\\nIt is well known from Kraft’s and McMillan’s theorems\\nthat the Huffman code, which is optimal in the class of\\ninstantaneous codes (i.e. preﬁx codes), is also optimal in the\\nclass of uniquely decodable codes if a ﬁxed single code tree is\\nused. However, AIFV (almost instantaneous ﬁxed-to-variable\\nlength) codes were proposed recently [1], [2], which uses\\ntwo (resp. K −1) code trees for the binary (resp. K-ary)\\ncode alphabet, and it was shown that the AIFV codes can\\nattain better compression rate than the Huffman codes for\\ni.i.d. sources. Since source symbols are assigned to incomplete\\ninternal nodes in addition to leaves in the AIFV codes, they\\nare not instantaneous codes. But, they are devised so that the\\ndecoding delay is at most 2 bits (resp. one code symbol) for\\nthe binary (resp. K-ary) codes. Hence the codes are called\\nalmost instantaneous.\\nThe average code length of the binary Huffman code LH is\\nbounded by H(X) ≤LH < H(X) + 1, and the upper bound\\nis tight when pmax →1, where pmax is the probability of\\nthe most probable source symbol, i.e. pmax = maxx∈X p(x).\\nOn the other hand, the average code length of the optimal\\nbinary AIFV code LAIFV is bounded by H(X) ≤LAIFV <\\nH(X)+0.5 and the upper bound is tight when pmax →1 [3].\\nNote that LH cannot become shorter than one in any case, but\\nLAIFV can become shorter than one when pmax is large.\\nThe binary AIFV codes, which use two code trees and have\\nat most 2-bit decoding delay, can be extended to the binary\\nAIFV-m codes, which use m code trees and have at most\\nm-bit decoding delay for m ≥2. The binary AIFV-2 codes\\ncorrespond to the original binary AIFV codes. Furthermore,\\nit is proved that the average length of the optimal AIFV-m\\ncode LAIFV-m is bounded by H(X) ≤LAIFV-m < H(X) + 1\\nm\\nfor 2 ≤m ≤4 [3]. We note that the Huffman codes for\\nextended alphabet X m can also attain the same bound. But, in\\nthe case of Huffman codes for X m, the size of the code tree is\\nO(|X|m) and the largest decoding delay becomes much larger\\nthan m bits for the ﬁrst symbol of xm ∈X m since m source\\nsymbols xm are decoded at once. In contrast, in the case of\\nthe AIFV-m codes, the total size of code trees is O(m|X|)\\nand the decoding delay is at most m bits. Hence, the AIFV-m\\ncodes are superior to the Huffman codes for X m in terms of\\nmemory size and decoding delay.\\nFor a given source, the optimal AIFV code can be con-\\nstructed by an iterative optimization algorithm combined with\\ninteger programing [2] or dynamic programming [4]. Fur-\\nthermore, the optimal binary AIFV-m code trees can also be\\nconstructed by the iterative optimization algorithm combined\\nwith a dynamic programming algorithm of time complexity\\nO(mn2m+1) and space complexity O(mnm+1) for 2 ≤m ≤\\n5, where n = |X| [5].\\nFor sources with n = |X|, the total number of binary\\nHuffman code trees is given by the (n−1)-th Catalan number\\nCn−1 while the total number of binary AIFV code trees is\\ngiven by the (n −1)-th large Schr¨oder number Sn−1, which\\nis the total number of Schr¨oder paths [6]. Since it holds that\\nlog2 Cn = 2n+o(n) and log2 Sn = n log2(3+2\\n√\\n2)+o(n) ≈\\n2.5431n + o(n), binary AIFV codes have a great variety of\\ncode trees compared with Huffman codes. Since there is a\\nbijection between the set of binary AIFV code trees and the\\nset of Schr¨oder paths, each AIFV code tree can be represented\\nwith ⌈log2 Sn−1⌉bits by using the bijection [6].\\nIf the probability distribution of a source is unknown, we\\ncan use the adaptive (dynamic) Huffman code instead of the\\nstatic Huffman code. In the case of AIFV codes, it is very\\ndifﬁcult to obtain an algorithm to update code trees adaptively\\nand optimally for given source sequences. However, it is\\nshown that (non-optimal) binary AIFV code trees can easily be\\nconstructed from the Huffman code tree by applying a certain\\noperation to each pair of sibling with a leaf such that the\\nprobability weight of the leaf is more than twice as large as the\\none of the other sibling node [3]. Hence, adaptive AIFV coding\\ncan be realized by the AIFV code trees derived from the\\nHuffman code tree which is updated adaptively by the dynamic\\nHuffman algorithm. For source sequences with pmax > 0.5,\\nthe above adaptive AIFV code can improve compression rate\\nconsiderably compared with the dynamic Huffman code [7].\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] H. Yamamoto and X.

The target applications cover\\nmainly Indoor low bite rate communication services for home automation and building control. Important industrial\\ndevelopment has been carried out to produce and deploy NB-PLC in the low frequency band less than 500 kHz by\\nusing single carrier modulations. Multiple standards BACnet [1], KNX (ISO/IEC 14543-3-5, EN 50090) [2], and LON\\n(ISO/IEC 14908-3, ANSI 709.2) [3], [4] have been released and are being considered for future Smart Home services.\\nThis category of NB-PLC is not succeeding to reach the great commercial success through mass deployment mainly\\ndue to the strong competition of low-cost short range wireless solutions.\\nToday, the massive IoT deployment by using wireless technology is facing the big challenge of limited radio spectrum\\nresources and more restrictive EMC regulation that is limiting the indoor radio propagation inside buildings. This\\noﬀers an important opportunity to promote NB-PLC that will allow relaxing the occupation of the radio spectrum\\nand overcome indoor poor radio propagation issues. Following the top-down modelling approach, a new parametric\\nmodel was proposed for the narrowband PLC channel transfer function taking into account power lines transmission\\ncharacteristics at the low frequency range. The proposed model was validated through ﬁeld measurements in the\\nCENELEC/FCC/ARIB bands using the Matrix Pencil algorithm for model parameters identiﬁcation.

In order to adapt the modulation technique to the\\ntarget indoor powerline environment in the CENELEC (9-490 kHz), FCC (9-490 kHz) and ARIB (9-450 kHz) bands, the\\nPLC channel frequency response in the presence of background and impulse noise are considered to compare modulation\\ntechniques and deﬁne the optimal demodulation processing architecture [5], [6]. Obtained simulation results, by using\\nmeasured indoor channel frequency response and noise, are showing superior performances with M-ary FSK combined\\nwith permutation code [7]. Considering the impact of the PLC Modem hardware implementation on the communication\\nperformances and the product cost this research work is also studying the cost eﬀective optimal performance design.\\nSpecial interest is given to the robustness analysis of the coupling and analog front-end interface to overcome the power\\nline impedance variation with a standard compliant design.

SUMMARY\\nIn this talk, we revisit a folklore which is stated as follows:1\\nGiven a good variable-length lossless code with\\ncodeword length ℓn(xn) for each xn ∈X n, the set\\nCn = {xn : ℓn(xn) ≤nR} of sequences for which\\nthe codeword length ℓn(xn) is smaller than or equal\\nto the given threshold nR gives a good ﬁxed-length\\ncode with the coding rate R.\\nIn the statement above, the goodness of codes is not well de-\\nﬁned. The purpose of this study is to give precise formulation\\nfor this folklore. In particular, we consider this problem from\\nthe aspect of universal source coding [2], [3].\\nIn summary, we apply universal ﬁxed-to-variable length\\n(FV) lossless codes to\\n(1) ﬁxed-to-ﬁxed length (FF) coding allowing non-vanishing\\nerror probability, as known as ε-FF coding, and\\n(2) FV coding allowing non-vanishing error probability, as\\nknown as ε-FV coding.\\nOur results demonstrate that we can construct a universal ε-FF\\ncode and a universal ε-FV code from a universal FV lossless\\ncode.2\\nII. KEY IDEA (“CONCEPT” OF THIS TALK)\\nThe results of this talk depend heavily on the result of Koga\\nand Yamamoto [6, Theorem 2]: Assume that the codeword\\nlength ℓn(xn) of an FV lossless code satisﬁes,3 for an infor-\\nmation source X = {Xn}∞\\nn=1,\\n1\\nnE [ℓn(Xn)] −1\\nnH(Xn) →0\\n(n →∞),\\nwhere H(Xn) denotes the entropy of Xn. Then, under a\\ncertain condition,\\n1\\nnℓn(Xn) −1\\nn log\\n1\\nPXn(Xn) →0\\n1The connection between the error probability of FF codes and the overﬂow\\nprobability of FV codes, which is shown by Uchida and Han [1], gives a\\ntheoretical support for this folklore.\\n2A similar problem was studied by the author [4], [5], where relations\\nbetween universal FV coding and FF coding with vanishing error probability\\nare investigated. In this sense, this paper gives a slight generalization of [4],\\n[5].\\n3It may be worth to note that the codeword length of an FV lossless code\\ncan be characterized by an integer-valued function ℓn(xn) satisfying the Kraft\\ninequality !\\nxn 2−ℓn(xn) ≤1.\\nin probability as n →∞, where PXn denotes the probability\\ndistribution of Xn.\\nRoughly speaking, the above result guarantees that we can\\napproximate the entropy-spectrum of the source (i.e., the dis-\\ntribution of the entropy density rate (1/n) log(1/PXn(Xn)))\\nby using the distribution of the codeword length per symbol\\nℓn(Xn)/n.\\nBased on this fact, we can demonstrate the following results:\\n(1) If there exists a universal FV lossless code for a set of\\nsources Ωthen the set Cn = {xn : ℓn(xn) ≤nR}\\nof sequences for which the codeword length ℓn(xn) is\\nsmaller than or equal to the given threshold nR gives a\\nuniversal FF code allowing errors for Ω.\\n(2) Let us construct an FV code with codeword length ˆℓn(xn)\\nsuch that\\n(i)\\nˆℓn(xn) =\\n!\\n1 + ℓn(xn)\\nif xn ∈Cn\\n1\\notherwise.\\n(ii) All xn ∈Cn can be reconstructed at the decoder.\\nThen, the constructed FV code can achieves the optimal\\ntrade-off between the average codeword length and the\\nerror probability universally for Ω.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\nThis work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Num-\\nber 26820145.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] O.

It turns out that we may indeed\\nobtain useful results using information-theoretic methods, if\\nwe are able to deﬁne an operational means of what is relevant.\\nAn example could be a data base of a machine M, which\\ncontains the ”class” y of M as a function of time t, where in\\nthe remainder the class y ∈{0, 1} is assumed to be binary,\\nand it corresponds to M being ”up” or ”down”. Furthermore,\\nthe data base contains the recordings of many sensors ¯x of\\nM (often called ”features” in data science), also as a function\\nof time t. For notational convenience, we henceforth use the\\nnotation x for the random variables corresponding to the\\nrecording of the features, both for the scalar and the vector\\ncase. The relevant information to be extracted from the data\\nbase can now, for example, be deﬁned as ﬁnding a possibly\\nsimple predictive model that is able to predict reliably the\\nclass y of machine M at some point in the future, given the\\nrecorded realizations of all sensors x in the past up to the\\ncurrent time t0. Mathematically, one is looking in this case\\nfor a possibly simple p(y|x), which represents a stochastic\\nfunction of how y depends on the features x.\\nIt turns out that very often, most of the information in\\nthe data base is of little or no importance in establishing\\nsuch a model. A major part of the time of a data analist\\nis devoted to establishing which components of x might be\\nrelevant for predicting y, and how to quantize and combine\\nthese components in a useful, relatively simple model.\\nInformation-theoretic methods, as explained hereafter, may\\nactually formalize these procedures in an optimal and auto-\\nmated manner. As mentioned before, these procedures should\\nbe able to discard most of the available information in the data\\nbase, e.g.,\\n• non-relevant information,\\n• too much detail,\\n• noise,\\n• errors,\\nin such a manner, that the relevant information is presented in\\na concise and useful model. As we explain in the remainder,\\nsuch discarding while retaining the relevant information, can\\nbe seen as a form of quantization of the data base.\\nIn a seminal article, Tishby et al. propose the Information\\nBottleneck Method [1]. In this paper, the authors present an\\ninformation-theoretic way of quantifying the concept ”retain-\\ning relevant information” in a useful manner. Their way of\\nthinking can be seen as an extension of rate distortion theory.\\nClassical rate distortion theory sets information-theoretic\\nbounds on what can be achieved by (vector) quantizers in\\nterms of a trade-off between distortion of a source signal\\nand the bit rate for representing the source [2], [3]. Also\\nin the Information Bottleneck method, retaining of relevant\\ninformation is approached by assuming that such can be\\nachieved by a proper quantization of the data base, which we\\nfrom now on call ”Tishby quantization”.\\nIn rate distortion theory, a rate distortion function R(D) is\\nintroduced, which provides a bound on the performance of\\n(vector) quantizers for a given source, in terms of a minimal\\naverage distortion D that is attainable for a certain average bit\\nrate R. Let’s assume that a ﬁxed vector quantizer Q maps the\\nsignal x onto a quantized version x′, Q : x \"→x′. In classical\\nrate distortion theory, known distortion measures are e.g.:\\n• Euclidean distance: dE(x, x′) = ||x −x′||2,\\n• Hamming distance: dH(x, x′) = wt(x−x′), where wt(z)\\ncorresponds to the number on non-zero components of z.\\nIn classical rate distortion theory, everything revolves around\\nthe variables x, its quantized version x′, and a distortion that\\nonly depends on x and x′.\\nIn the setting of predicting y using a set of quantized\\nfeatures x′, i.e., generating a ”good” p(y|x′), the idea put\\nforward by Tishby et al., is to deﬁne a Kullback-Leibler (KL)\\ndistortion measure on p(y|x′), where now the random variable\\ny also is included. Tishby et al. deﬁne\\nd(y)\\nKL(x, x′) =\\n!\\ny\\np(y|x) log p(y|x)\\np(y|x′),\\n(1)\\nwhere the distortion d(y)\\nKL(x, x′) reﬂects the loss of relevant\\ninformation concerning y when features x′ are used for\\npredicting y in stead of using features x. As mentioned before,\\none may think of x′ as being (vector) quantized versions of x.\\nIn Fig. 1, we depict an example of the idea of Tishby\\nquantization in a block diagram. In the example, the subject\\nof interest is a machine M that is characterized by a class\\ny (”up” or ”down”) as a function of time. Furthermore, M\\noutputs a set of features x as a function of time. We have not\\nindicated the time t explicitly, as we may be interested in the\\ninformation that past realizations of x may provide about the\\ncurrent y. Moreover, different components of the vector x may\\n25\\n25\\n2\\nrefer to the same physical sensor taken at different times in\\nthe past.\\nFig. 1: Example of Tishby Quantization\\nThe mutual information I(X; Y ) corresponds to the average\\namount of relevant information that realizations of the features\\nx may provide about the class y. If we quantize features x\\ninto x′, we incur a KL-distortion d(y)\\nKL(x, x′) as given by (1).\\nAccording to rate distortion theory [3], there exist quantizers\\nQ : x !→x′ that on average only need a rate R(D) bits per\\ntransmission for representing the signal x with an average KL-\\ndistortion at most D, where\\nR(D) =\\nmin\\np(x′|x):!\\nx,x′ p(x)p(x′|x)·d(y)\\nKL(x,x′)≤D\\nI(X; X′).\\n(2)\\nIf the quantizer is deterministic, we have in addition\\nH(X′|X) = 0\\n⇒\\nI(X; X′) = H(X′).\\n(3)\\nAs a result from Tishby quantization, we ﬁnally have an efﬁ-\\ncient description x′ of new features that can be extracted from\\nthe data base, costing on average H(X′) bits per realization for\\ntransmission (or storage), with the corresponding p(y|x′) for\\npredicting the class y using x′, which still provides the largest\\npossible amount of information I(X′; Y ) concerning the class\\ny of machine M (given that we started with features x).\\nKullback-Leibler Distortion\\nThe Kullback-Leibler distortion (1) or information diver-\\ngence [3], [4] between the conditional distributions p(y|x) and\\np(y|x′) is a measure for the amount of bits of information that\\nis lost, if one uses x′ to predict y in stead of x. One can show\\neasily that\\nEx,x′\\n!\\nd(y)\\nKL(x, x′)\\n\"\\n= I(X; Y ) −I(X′; Y ),\\n(4)\\nhence, the average KL-distortion between p(y|x) and p(y|x′)\\nequals the loss in average mutual information about Y due to\\nthe quantization of x into x′, where Y is the relevant quantity\\nof the data base.\\nModiﬁed Lloyd Algorithm\\nTishby et al. [1] discuss information-theoretic consequences\\nof their approach, in particular of ﬁnding bounds that cor-\\nrespond to a rate-distortion function R(D). For ﬁnding (an\\napproximation to) a Tishby quantizer of a realization of an\\nunknown data source, one may consider a modiﬁcation of the\\nwell-known extended Lloyd algorithm [5], as is also discussed\\nby [6], [7]. The modiﬁed Lloyd algorithm is an iterative\\nalgorithm, containing three steps in each iteration, which also\\nallows for estimating the cost of transmission:\\n1) given a partitioning of x, ﬁnd the best representative x′\\nin each partition:\\nx′ = argminx′′Ex∈partition\\n!\\nd(y)\\nKL(x, x′′)\\n\"\\n(5)\\n2) given a partitioning of x and the resulting p(x′) on\\nthe representatives of the partitioned x, ﬁnd the length\\ndistribution l of an optimal variable length code:\\nl(x′) = −log p(x′)\\n(6)\\n3) given the representatives x′, ﬁnd the best partitioning by\\nassigning each data point x to the representative x′ that\\nminimizes:\\nd(y)\\nKL(x, x′) + λ · l(x′)\\n(7)\\nwhere λ is a Lagrange parameter balancing the costs of\\ndistortion and transmission.\\nBy picking λ, we can choose between a course quantization\\nleading to a short description x′ of the features, that has a\\nrelatively high loss of information concerning y (λ large),\\nor a longer description resulting from a ﬁner quantization\\nthat contains much more detail concerning y (λ small). Of\\ncourse, the information-theoretic interesting aspect is to ﬁnd\\nthe largest possible I(X′; Y ) for a given average description\\nlength H(X′). Note that the extended Lloyd algorithm can\\nbe applied both on a scalar x (scalar quantization), and on a\\nvector x (vector quantization).\\nTypically, the modiﬁed Lloyd algorithm starts off in a\\nspace x of high-resolution quantized features, where in each\\nbin of the space the relevant probabilities p(x|y), p(x) and\\np(y|x) can be deﬁned, estimated or computed. The algorithm\\nsubsequently performs an optimal partitioning of this space\\ninto K regions x′ by a clustering of the high-resolution bins x.\\nIt seems that both the number K and a good initial location\\nof x′ must be found experimentally.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] N.Tishby, F.C.

It is well known that MPC is important for applications of cryptography, e.g., for computing statistics of\\ncloud data. MPC is also fascinating for understanding and enjoying cryptography since it can be implemented by\\nusing a deck of playing cards [1], which is called “card-based cryptographic protocol”. We address in this talk a card-\\nbased cryptographic protocol for secure comparison of two numbers, called millionaires’ problem, which is a traditional\\nproblem in MPC initiated by Yao’s seminal work [2].\\nOur original motivation presented in [3] is to propose eﬃcient card-based cryptographic protocols for millionaires’\\nproblem in terms of MPC, i.e., communication complexities and number of cards used in the protocol. In this talk,\\nhowever, we rather focus on an interesting relation between the proposed protocol and a famous logic puzzle “The fork\\nin the road” (e.g., see [4]), which was ﬁrstly pointed in [3].\\nIn the proposed protocol, we assume that the wealth of Alice and Bob is represented by bits, and they execute\\nbitwise comparisons for their wealth. In each bitwise comparison, Alice sends her bit or its negation to Bob without\\ntelling him which one of them is sent. Even if she tells a lie on her bit, it is possible to compare her bit with Bob’s one\\nby introducing a technique borrowed from “The fork in the road.”\\nAcknowledgement\\nThis work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP26420345, JP15H02710, and JP17H01752.\\nReferences\\n[1] B. den Boer, “More eﬃcient match making and satisﬁability: the ﬁve card trick,” in Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO’93, LNCS773,\\npp. 208-217, Springer-Verlag, 1990.\\n[2] A.Yao, “Protocols for secure computations,” IEEE Symposium on FOCS, vol. 23 pp. 160-164, IEEE, 1982.\\n[3] T.

These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\\n\\n\\n=== Reasoning and problem-solving ===\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\n\\n=== Knowledge representation ===\\n\\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make '),\n",

In contrast, weak AI (or narrow AI) is able to solve one specific problem but lacks general cognitive abilities. Some academic sources use \"weak AI\" to refer more broadly to any programs that neither experience consciousness nor have a mind in the same sense as humans.\\nRelated concepts include artificial superintelligence and transformative AI. An artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical type of AGI that is much more generally intelligent than humans, while the notion of transformative AI relates to AI having a large impact on society, for example, similar to the agricultural or industrial revolution.\\nA framework for classifying AGI by performance and autonomy was proposed in 2023 by Google DeepMind researchers. They define five performance levels of AGI: emerging, competent, expert, virtuoso, and superhuman. For example, a competent AGI is defined as an AI that outperforms 50% of skilled adults in a wide range of non-physical tasks, and a superhuman AGI (i.e. an artificial superintelligence) is similarly defined but with a threshold of 100%. They consider large language models like ChatGPT or LLaMA 2 to be instances of emerging AGI (comparable to unskilled humans). Regarding the autonomy of AGI and associated risks, they define five levels: tool (fully in human control), consultant, collaborator, expert, and agent (fully autonomous).\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\n\\nVarious popular definitions of intelligence have been proposed. One of the leading proposals is the Turing test. However, there are other well-known definitions, and some researchers disagree with the more popular approaches.\\n\\n\\n=== Intelligence traits ===\\nResearchers generally hold that a system is required to do all of the following to be regarded as an AGI:\\n\\nreason, use strategy, solve puzzles, and make judg')]"
